""""
Program Goals:
1. Get input from user (at multiple stages)
2. Convert some, but not all, inputs to INTs from STRs
3. We need to provide the user with choices:
    a. Add more values to a list
    b. Return a value at a specific index position
4. Add search algorithms to program:
    a. Random Search
    b. Linear Search
    c. Binary Search (2 Types)
